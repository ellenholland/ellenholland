                <p>Digital Women is a club dedicated to women in computing majors. This includes but of course is not
                  limited to majors such as Computer Science, Software Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Electrical
                  Engineering. Our goal is to provide a comfortable environment for women to network with companies and
