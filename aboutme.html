            <p>
            Digital Women is a club dedicated to women in computing majors. This includes but of course is not
            limited to majors such as Computer Science, Software Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Electrical

            As secretary I am in charge of taking meeting notes and sending (exciting) emails. As Vice President, I
            help the President with decision making and reminding/notifying executives and members of important
            events or tasks that need to be done. I am also the founder of Digital Women's <a
